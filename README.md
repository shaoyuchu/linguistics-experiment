# Does Character Order Affect Reading Comprehension in Mandarin?

### Introduction

People type with typos or unordered words inevitably. But surprisingly, we still get to understand these passages with minor errors.
> e.g. 研表究明，漢字的序順並不定一影閱響讀，比如當你看完這句話後，才發這現裡的字全是都亂的。

In this research, we focused on misordered characters in Mandarin and aim to answer the following research questions:

1. ***What types of "mess" can we tolerate in reading comprehension?***
2. ***How "messy" can an understandable sentence be?***

For the research details and experiment results, please refer to [the slides](slides/Does%20Character%20Order%20Affect%20Reading%20Comprehension%20in%20Mandarin_.pdf).
